ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’» Guess the Secret: Number Challenge
Write a program where the user has to guess a secret number between 1 and 10.
The program provides feedback if the guess is too high or too low, and congratulates the user if they guess correctly.


HINT: Remember that random module we used a few lessons ago? It would be extremely helpful here... 

Steps:

Randomly select a secret number between 1-10. âœ…
Ask the user to make a guess between 1-10.

If the user is correct, print "Congratulations, You guessed the secret number!"
If the user is too low, print "Too low!"
If the user is too high, print "Too high!"
