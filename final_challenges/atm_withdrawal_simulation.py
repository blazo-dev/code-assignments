ðŸ‘¾ðŸ’»Final Challenge: Create a program that simulates an ATM withdrawal process. 

The program should:
Allow the user to input an amount to withdraw.
Raise an exception if the input is invalid (non-numeric or negative). âœ…
Ensure that the withdrawal doesnâ€™t exceed the account balance, raising an appropriate exception. âœ…
Always display the remaining balance, even if an error occurs.
